        <h2> Reflection Notes </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the project, I started by designing the page using HTML then I used Bootstrap to format the page in the right order.
                I feel like I created more work for myself by doing this because I kept having to copy and paste the work I had into the new
                columns and rows that I was making with Bootstrap. This really confused me and added a lot of time that I spent working on it. 
            </li>
            <li>One thing that I found to be very challenging was to get each page linked in the right format. I was able to easily get it linked as a 
                list but struggled with the desired format.
            </li>
            <li>Another issue I kept running into was that my paragraphs were all bolded. I realized I had them listed inside of the header instead of 
                under.
            </li>
            <li>For my menu, I had orginally had each page linked as a list using standard HTML format. When I switched it to the CSS Framework, each
                work was right next to each other. I had to look up how to fix this and add the justify content around class between each item to create
                the spacing that I was wanting. 
            </li>
            <li>One of the first things I did was add the header and menu to each page by copy and pasting it. I had to be very mindful when I was doing 
                this to make sure that I didn't accidentlly leave something I orginally had. I wish I would have started by doing this to each page instead
                of trying to start with what I knew how to do then making changes. Once again, I feel like I created more work for myself as I went.
            </li>
            <li>After I figured out the CSS Framework, I created a little template for myself and copied and pasted it on each page. I fixed one portion at
                a time on each page to ensure that I wasn't missing anything. It was very tedious, but I was very proud of myself. On my first CSS project in 
                one of our intro classes over the summer, I felt very overwhelmed when I made something more confusing for myself. However on this project, I 
                chose to work through it using better problem solving skills. I read through the Bootstrap getting started docs to understand it better and 
                watched a couple Youtube videos of different people using it. It really helped me understand how it worked and be able to apply it to my 
                project. However, I still wish I would have done that before writing everything in HTML because I had to make so many changes to the page. 
            </li>
            <li>Overall, I would like to explore more with Bootstap and try some of the different features that it offers. However, between my classes and
                schedule, I did not have time to do this on this project. 
            </li>
        </ul>
